# ST 

Build of [ST](https://st.suckless.org/) with some patches to make it more useable.

The [st-copyout](st-copyout) and [st-urlhandler](st-urlhandler) scripts are taken from this [repo](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st).

The following patches have been applied:

- alpha
- anysize
- clipboard
- dynamic-cursor-color
- externalpipe
- font2
- scrollback
- scrollback-mouse
- xresources 
- desktopentry
- netwmicon

Colours defined in `~/.Xresources` are used if available, otherwise the [iceberg](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim) colourscheme is used.
